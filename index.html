      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I could jabber on, but for the sake of simplicity I'll boil it down to pertinent keywords. Single mom. Sewing. Knitting. Historybounding. Fashion history. ADHD. VW. Tinkering. 
        CAD. Cooking. Shenanigans. Intersectional Feminism.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born into an Air Force family, therefore I've lived a lot of places before getting stuck in SE Kansas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Historybounding. Fashion history. Tinkering. Shenanigans with my momsters. Knitting.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At my most recent job, I ended up taking on all manner of orphan project. I loved taking on the challenge of figuring out how to do things I didn't previously know how to do. 
        Probably my favorite project that I created to solve a problem involved making a gianormous spreadsheet to manage options & dependencies, sizing, and prices. I dabbled in 
      creating a database for it instead of a spreadsheet, and that would have been the ideal solution had the company I worked for been willing to provide me with something other than 
      OpenOffice Base to accomplish that. I simply had too much information being shuffled and calculated for OpenOffice.</p>
      <p>So, to answer the question, my dream job uses the same part of my brain that I used to figure out the way we were checking the information line by line and item by item was 
        ridiculous and needed to be updated. It would also afford me the flexibility to manage life as a single mom while still providing me with the means to provide. Lastly, it would 
      give me "puzzles" to solve that I would enjoy letting roll around in my head while working on whatever hobby or mundane adulting outside of work.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a tiny town in SE Kansas. The kind of town that has exactly 1 stop light because the highway is also Main Street.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have a unique brain that balances aesthetic and logic. I love challenges that experience has shown database work and back end developement would fill. I also love the 
        aesthetics and making beautiful things that work the way they're supposed to. Most importantly, I want to be able to provide for my kids in a better fashion, and not feel so 
        totally stuck in an area where there's little to no need for my unusual mix of job skills, so earning potential is definitely high on the list of reasons.</p>
